你好 (Hi),
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, advised by Prof. Christopher Amato and Prof. Lawson Wong.

Previously, I received my B.S. and M.S. from Nankai University (China) where I was fortunate to work with Prof. Feng Duan on computer vision and autonomous driving.
